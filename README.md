![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/09/07/X5TnUGN1LAjDmf3.png)

This is implemented by using `socked.io`.

##### 🎥 Video and audio consultation

This type of consultation is based on **peerjs**, which encapsulates **WebRTC**.
![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/09/07/Gv5FrDK9pkxNJ3w.png)

###### 📜 Implementation:

- Each consultation has a unique room id generated by `uuid`.
- Each user(peer onject) has a unique id generated by `uuid`(generated by `peerjs`).
- When a user join the room, it will emit a `user-connected` event to the room, along with the `roomId` and `userId`(peer object id).
- The backend will listen to the `user-connected` event, broadcast a "user-connected" event to all users in the room, along with `userId`(peer object id) of the user who connected.
- When the peer get "user-connected" event, it will try call the peer by its `userId`.
- When a user get a call, it will answer it with its video stream.

###### 🛠️ Solved issues:

- The issue of establishing P2P connection between two different network is solved by using `TURN` and `STUN` server provided by [Open Relay](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/).
- The `peer` server is provided by [peerjs](https://status.peerjs.com/ib0l).
- The communication of id for peer object is achieved by `websocket.io`.
